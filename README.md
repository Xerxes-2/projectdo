# `t` For Test

`t` makes it easy to run tests from the command line. The single letter command
automatically runs the appropriate tests in any project.

```sh
../any-project > t
# runs `cargo test` in a Rust project
# runs `npm test` in a NodeJS project
# runs `stack test` in a Haskell project
# ... etc.
```

## What

`t` For Test is a portable shell script that automatically detects the
appropriate test command to run in the nearest project root relative to where
it is executed. For instance, it detects a Rust project based on the presence
of a `Cargo.toml` file and then runs `cargo test`, etc.

With `t` For Test you can swiftly run tests in any project by typing only
<kbd>t</kbd>+<kbd>enter</kbd>. Treat it as a key-stroke saving short-cut that
always expands to the test command you want to write.

## Features

* Implemented as a dependency free portable POSIX shell script.
* Provides helpful error messages in case tests are not available or cannot be
  run.
* Works with many different programming languages and project configurations.
  [See the entire list here](#supported-tools-and-languages).
* Easy to extend with support for new configurations.

## Install

### From source

Download the script and place it somewhere in your path. For instance:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paldepind/t/master/t -o ~/bin/t
chmod +x ~/bin/t
```

If `~/bin` is in your path you can now run tests with `t`.

### npm

T For Test can be installed from npm (easy if you're already using npm).

```
npm i --global @paldepind/tst
```

This automatically adds `t` to your path.

## Usage

**Note**: When executed with the `-d` flag `t` does a dry run and only prints
information about what it would do without actually doing anything. It is a
good idea to do a dry run when using `t` in a project for the first time to
verify that it does the right thing.

```
Usage: t [options]
Options:
  -h, --help             Display this help.
  -n, -d, --dry-run      Do not execute any commands with side-effects.
  -q, --quiet            Suppress all normal output. Only errors are printed to stderr.
  -v, --version          Display the version of the program (which is 0.1.0).
```
